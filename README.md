What is our project about?

How covid effected the home buying experience in San Diego between 2020 and 2022?

Why did we do this?

The Covid Pandemic is a major event that will define us for the rest of our lives. This is the time of our lives where we are transitioning to full adulthood, finally getting all of the worries, rewards, and responsobilities of this stage of development. A defining step of adulthood is owning your own home, which appears to be more difficult this time than in ages past. We would like to know if the housing market will follow the trends of covid cases, or follow historical trends of the housing market in the future. We will look at how Covid Cases affected various elements of the housing market such as Sale to List Price, Housing Price, and Rent Price. Additionally we will see if employment affects the housing market.


Datasets:

Biobot analytics RNA concentration in Waste water
Biobot analytics cases per 100,000


ML Model

This is still under construction. For now our plan is to have univariate analysis on a few key features of the housing market, and covid cases. We will have a multivariate model, and see if it is better than the univariate. Our measure of understading if covid effected the housing market significantly is to see whether the univariate, or the multivariate model performs better. 1 indicator is shown below
