# Final_project_Covid19



Ian:


Our Datasets and what our starting Database


The John Hopkins Dataset

We will use the Date, State, people_viral_positive, sections of the
dictionairy for the purpose of showing the infection rate fpr a state

  {
    "date": 20200408,
    "state": "AK",
    "people_viral_positive": 226,
    "tests_viral_positive": null,
    "tests_viral_negative": null,
    "encounters_viral_total": null,
    "tests_viral_total": 7068,
    "people_viral_total": null,
    "tests_combined_total": 7068,
    "cases_conf_probable": 226,
    "people_antigen_positive": null,
    "people_antigen_total": null,
    "cases_confirmed": null,
    "cases_probable": null
  },


NWSS_Public_SARS-CoV-2_Wastewater_Metric_Data


We will look at the 
ptc_15d (which stands for the 15 day percentage change in RNA levels)
reporting jursdiction
date_start
date_end 

Provisional_COVID-19_Deaths_by_Sex_and_Age

We will look at the

Start Date
End Date

State
Sex
Age Group
COVID-19 Deaths 
Total Deaths
Pneumonia Deaths	
Pneumonia and COVID-19 Deaths	
Influenza Deaths	
Pneumonia, Influenza, or COVID-19 Deaths


Conditions_Contributing_to_COVID-19_Deaths__by_State_and_Age__Provisional_2020-2022

We will use following columns

Covid Waste Water

For ML model 
We will investigate whether a dataset showing the RNA levels of covid in waste water
can better predict the infection rate than a dataset that doesn't have the RNA levels
of covid in waste water. 


Also we will understand the role of age, comorbidites, gender have on infection rate
and morbidity rate. Are they multipliers, or do they hava negligble effect.
