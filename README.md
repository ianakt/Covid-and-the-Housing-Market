For ML model 
We will investigate whether a dataset showing the RNA levels of covid in waste water
can better predict the infection rate than a dataset that doesn't have the RNA levels
of covid in waste water. 


Also we will understand the role of age, comorbidites, gender have on infection rate
and morbidity rate. Are they multipliers, or do they hava negligble effect.
