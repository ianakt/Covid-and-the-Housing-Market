# Final_project_Covid19




Our journey so far....

We are in search of features that can predict covid cases in the short to medium term for a given period.

One feature that we have selected so far is RNA concentration in wastewater, as you can see below there is a strong correlation between, RNA concentration and 		covid case population.

Datasets:

Biobot analytics RNA concentration in Waste water
Biobot analytics cases per 100,000


ML model:

Our hope for our ML model is to see if we can predict covid cases over time using various features. For now we have loaded the covid cases per 100,000 (a univariate model) perhaps we will see some frequency over time using this alone. However we plan to have a multivariate ARIMA model that can predict covid over time. To test this we may use the year 2020 to predict 2021, seeing as that the covid pandemic is an ongoing crisis. more details to come


Please look  at file Waste_water_group_by.ipynb for our ML model
