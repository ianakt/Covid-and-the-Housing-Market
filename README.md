# Final_project_Covid19


What is our project about?

How covid effected the home buying experience in San Diego between 2020 and 2022?

Why did we do this?

The Covid Pandemic is a major event that will define us for the rest of our lives. This is the time of our lives where we are transitioning to full adulthood, finally getting all of the worries, rewards, and responsobilities of this stage of development. A defining step of adulthood is owning your own home, which appears to be more difficult this time than in ages past. We would like to know if the housing market will follow the trends of covid cases, or follow historical trends of the housing market in the future. We will look at  how Covid Cases affected various elements of the housing market such as Sale to List Price, Housing Price, and Rent Price. Additionally we will see if employment affects the housing market.

Practical considerations for data sets:

Economic/Housing Data was cleaner, and required little no processing in regards to droping null values, the need to either add columns or delete columns. The Zillow Dataset was particularly interesting, it was the only one that needed to be Transposed. We found the covid data stramgely tricky from BioBot analytics, some cities had more data than others, which led us to selecting Miami-Dade County Florida at first, we then pivoted to San Diego in the hopes that there would be more data on housing seeing that it is a more populated county.





Did Covid have an effect on:
	- home prices
		yes
	- days to close
		no
	- list v sale price
		yes
	
Communication Protocol:

1. We encourage open and honest communication throughout the week via our slack channel for our group project, to discuss updates we make on either our individual and/or main branch

2. We meet at least twice a week MW 7-9, unless there is an event, in which case we will notify our team via slack


Database:

SQL Alchemy



ML Model

This is still under construction. For now our plan is to have univariate analysis on a few key features of the housing market, and covid cases. We will have a multivariate model, and see if it is better than the univariate. Our measure of understading if covid effected the housing market significantly is to see whether the univariate, or the multivariate model performs better. 1 indicator is shown below

How are we accounting covid cases?
	We are using waste water data and covid cases from biobot analytics
	
How do we confirm our hypothesis?
	ML model
